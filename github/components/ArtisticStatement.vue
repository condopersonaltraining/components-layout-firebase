        | <span class="subheading">M</span>y way of working is deeply rooted in the traditionality of my training and
        | experience as a Bharatanatyam dance artist however with an understanding that
        | my artistic role extends beyond culture and tradition but with a purpose in
        | questioning societyâ€™s beliefs, pushing boundaries, fighting prejudice, yet never
        | forgetting my roots.
    v-card.secondary.ma-3
      v-card-text
        | My artistic vision is to showcase the full potential of the art form I am trained in,
        | expand and push its boundaries and have it resonate with my experiences of the
        | world that I inhabit. I am interested in meaningful collaborations with my peers
        | practicing in other dance styles and to try and establish artistic dialogue along
        | themes that are far reaching and which go beyond that of a tradition; which
        | engage in issues such as gender, politics, economics, sexuality.
    v-card.secondary.ma-3
      v-card-text
        | My hope is to transform the dialogue around Bharatanatyam, to include new
        | perspectives from professional artists that are pushing boundaries and creating
        | compelling work.
